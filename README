Z(1)                             User Commands                            Z(1)



NAME
       z - jump around


SYNOPSIS
       z [-h] [-l] [-r] [-t] [regex1 regex2 ... regexn]


AVAILABILITY
       bash, zsh


DESCRIPTION
       Tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'.

       After  a  short  learning  phase, z will take you to the most 'frecent'
       directory that matches ALL of the regexes given on the command line.


OPTIONS
       -h show a brief help message
       -l list only
       -r match by rank only
       -t match by recent access only


EXAMPLES
       z foo     cd to most frecent dir matching foo
       z foo bar cd to most frecent dir matching foo and bar
       z -r foo  cd to highest ranked dir matching foo
       z -t foo  cd to most recently accessed dir matching foo
       z -l foo  list all dirs matching foo (by frecency)


NOTES
       Installation:

       put something like this in your $HOME/.bashrc:

        . /path/to/z.sh

       put something like this in your $HOME/.zshrc:

        . /path/to/z.sh
        function precmd () {
          z --add "$(pwd -P)"
        }

       cd around for a while to build up the db.
       PROFIT!!

       Frecency:

       Frecency is a portmantaeu of 'recent' and 'frequency'. It is a weighted
       rank  that depends on 'how often' and 'how recently' something occured.
       As far as I know, Mozilla came up with the term.

       In z, a directory that has low ranking but has been  accessed  recently
       will  quickly  have  higher rank than a directory accessed frequently a
       long time ago.
